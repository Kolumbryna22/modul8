            <h2>Stairway to heaven</h2>

        <div class="song-text">
            <p>There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
                And she's buying a stairway to heaven.
                When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
                With a word she can get what she came for.</p>
            <p>There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
                'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings.
                In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings,
                Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven. </p>
            <p>There's a feeling I get when I look to the west,
                And my spirit is crying for leaving.
                In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees,
                And the voices of those who stand looking.</p>
